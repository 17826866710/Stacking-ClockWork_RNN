# Stacking ClockWork_RNN
For time series, two parts:
1. Clockwork recurrent neural network part of self-regression, daily time series.
2. Penal data part of related factors, quarterly time series. Training weight with partial least squares.
3. Stacking, combine two predictions together with weight.
